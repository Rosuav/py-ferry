## What is it?
Right now, not much of anything; just a concept. I ride the Seattle - Bainbridge Island ferry each day and I am impressed with the smoothness of the operation. I also like simulation and strategy games. Among my favorites are SimCity, Civ, Pharaoh, Cities: Skylines, and so on. I also like more casual games like Mini Metro. I guess the scale doesn't matter to me as much as having some resource, business, or economic element.

## Where can I learn more?
There are some images in the /notes folder that are photos that were taken from some hand-written notes from a whiteboard and a notebook.

## Major To-Dos
