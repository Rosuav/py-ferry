* each of these "events" has a unique amount of demand, likelihood of a round-trip
* passenger won't initiate trip that's round-trip unless there's return options

basically, add events as a feature

# turns
* simulate routes
  start at midnight, run routes
* simulate construction

  * construction
  * route management

# shifts:
* 5 x 8

# ferry configuration
* number of decks:
  * passenger (min)
  * car
  * 2nd passenger (can't have without passenger)
  * commercial (can't have without truck)
double-ended or not?

# turn-over time

# staff

# customer satisfaction
availability (when pax want to make trips)
accessibility
wait times
reliability
staff quality

# who is a passenger?
* purpose
* departure time
* destination
* round trip?
* fare class


# other notes I found
chose between three boats
4 terminals on each side
pressure to determine ridership
events affect pressure
pressure is general plus may have a center

the pressure thing seems too complicated

users
	have profitability
	have ferries
	have routes
		have schedules
		
maybe instead of money, we can:
* use some sort of analog for resource simplication through *resource conversion*
* use passengers to earn staff
* use cars/vehicles to earn fuel
* get subsidy from the state to cover a certain amount of staff and fuel
* instead of acquisition cost, we could use customer credibilty/reputation

for example, 200 barrels of diesel and 30 staff could be a subsidy
dependent on difficulty?

staffing for terminals *and* ferries?

game balance is the big challenge
